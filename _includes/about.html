                    I am a PhD Candidate at Maastricht University, working jointly with the Institute of Data Science
                    and Studio Europa. My research focuses on using NLP for social media analysis, mostly aimed at
                    understanding the opinion of youth towards European issues. I am supervised by <a

                    From Jun/2019 to Dec/2019, I was an Applied Data Scientist at Microsoft's Search Technology Center
                    (Munich). I was a member of
                    the Intelligent Search team, and worked on approaches for improving the relevance of search results
                    for
                    users of Microsoft Teams.

                    From Sep/2017 to Jun/2018, I was a Research Student in Natural Language Processing at the University
                    of Sheffield, under the
                    supervision of <a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/L.Specia/">Prof. Lucia Specia</a>.
                    My research was focused on exploring the use of acoustic information to improve the
                    performance of multimodal NLP tasks -- focusing particularly on Machine Translation.

                    I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at the University of São
                    Paulo, under the supervision
                    of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_zZjhl8AAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Maria das Graças
                        Volpe Nunes</a>. My dissertation topic was Text Normalisation of User-generated Content for
                    Portuguese. I
                    worked on text normalisation methods based mostly on deep learning architectures and word embeddings
                    similarity. As part of
                    my research, I developed a free and open-source tool called Enelvo – a flexible text normaliser for
                    user-generated texts written in
                    Portuguese. I also built an annotated corpus of non-standard words in different domains.

                    I took my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the Western Paraná State University, with one
                    year spent abroad at Katholieke
                    Universiteit Leuven, in Belgium. During this period, I worked on various topics – including
                    computational epidemiology, ensembles
                    of neural networks, and sentiment analysis. Upon graduation, I was awarded the prizes of Best
                    Computer Science Graduate of 2015
                    and Outstanding Student in 2015, granted by the Brazilian Society for Computing.
